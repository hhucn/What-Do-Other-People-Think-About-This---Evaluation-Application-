                provides a more diverse set of opinions with a logical and coherent argument. This means that it
                contains arguments both for and against the topic of the user comment.

                If no set provides a better selection of comments than the other. Please click the button "No set of

                                is also about protecting others who are more vulnerable. </p></li>

                                - even though I'm fully vaccinated and boosted. That helped keep it mild in my case
                                (sore throat and burning eyes and a low fever). I've known a half-dozen people who've
                                had Covid in the last month. Since I successfully fought off the virus in 4 days, I
                                think I'm self-immunized for a few more months. I'll wait until the new vaccine is out.

                                studies. The risk from covid is far less than from the vaccines at this point.

                                    class="recommendation-comment">@MC A vaccine provides “instructions” to the body’s
                                immune systems to enable the immune system response to the invading microorganism to be
                                swifter and more specific. The person’s body does the work - all the vaccine provides is
                                a “picture” (antigen) that resembles the real microorganism. Like many things in life,
                                vaccines may not provide the perfect “picture” (in this case, the virus is changing
                                constantly), and not all people may be able to “recognize” the “picture”, so some
                                vaccines may not be perfectly functional for every single recipient.

                                There is a separate type of passive immunity (antiserum) where antibodies made by a
                                separate individual are injected into the individual at risk, in order to provide an
                                immediate response. An example is the rabies antiserum (immunoglobulin) - the bitten
                                person’s own immune system simply cannot respond quickly enough to stop the rabies
                                virus, which kills rapidly.
