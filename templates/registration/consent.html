        <h2>Dear participant,</h2>
        <div>
            <p>welcome and thank you for taking part in this study. There is a lot of debate in comment
                sections of news agencies. They offer users the possibility to participate in the public debate and
                discuss different points of view. However, there is a huge number of comments posted every day and many
                of these comments are not a constructive contribution to the discussion. Therefore, it is very
                difficult for users to get a good overview about different perspectives for a given topic.
            <p>
            As scientists, we want to support the public debate by recommending high-quality contributions by other
            users to the same topic. In order to do this, we present a selection of comments that provide different
            points of view for a single user
            comment. The idea is that users will be able to select a comment in a discussion that they find
            interesting, and be presented with a set of opinions that will help them understand different points of
            view on the topic of the selected comment.
            This way, we want to help people who want to participate in the public debate to get a well-informed
            opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this user-study, we are therefore interested in
                your individual assessment of the recommended comments and which set of comments provides a more
                thoughtful and elaborate perspective
                for the topic of the given user comment. You will be presented with recommendations for the same user
                comment
                time two times in random order. These selections are based on different recommendation methods which we
                want to compare.
            <p>
                PLEASE DO NOT ASSESS THE COMMENTS BASED ON THE STATED FACTS! WE ARE COMPLETE AWARE THAT SOME COMMENTS
                PROVIDE FALSE INFORMATION REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE ETC. IN THIS STUDY, WE ARE ONLY INTERESTED TO FIND
                COMMENTS THAT TAKE A POSITION ON THE ISSUE OF THE GIVEN USER COMMENT AND EXPLAIN WHY THEY THINK THEIR
                CONCLUSION IS CORRECT. FACT CHECKING IS OUT OF SCOPE FOR THIS USER STUDY.

            </p>
            <p>There is no right or wrong way to answer. Also, it is no problem
                if you are not quite sure about your answer. Most selections can and should be answered
                by gut feeling. It takes about 2-3 hours to complete the study. You can close your browser at any time
                and resume at a later time. The survey is
                for research purposes only.</p>
